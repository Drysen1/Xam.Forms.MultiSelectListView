# XamarinForms_MultiSelectListView

I was looking for a way to be able to multiselect in a listview in Xamarin Forms.
Found this in the documentation: https://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/controls/multiselect/
but I wanted a more "XAML-way" and "more MVVM-way" of doing it. Thus this solution.

App is really basic and works just as a shell to demonstrate a way to implement mutliselect in listview.
